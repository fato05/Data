- **Data Analysis**: A mix of T-SQL and Python-based analytics scripts for generating insights, aggregations, and visualizations.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployment of scripts and notebooks using Azure Pipelines.
- **Version Control**: Git-based tracking of changes to queries and scripts.
- **Collaboration**: Branching strategies and pull requests for team collaboration and code reviews.
- **Security**: Secrets and credentials managed via Azure Key Vault integration.
